							<h1 class="major">Campus Cupid</h1>
							<p>Campus Cupid is a cross-platform dating app designed specifically for college students. It uses Flutter for the front-end and Firebase for the back-end to provide users with a seamless experience. Unlike other dating apps, Campus Cupid doesn't rely on swipes. Instead, it uses a unique matching algorithm that pairs users based on how they answer Cupid's questions. These questions are designed to help users find people with similar interests, values, and personalities.</p>
							<h2>Matching Algorithm</h2>
							<p>The matching algorithm used by Campus Cupid takes into account a variety of factors when pairing users. These factors include interests, hobbies, values, and personalities. Users are asked a series of questions upon sign-up, and their responses are used to build a profile. Cupid's algorithm then analyzes this data to find potential matches based on compatibility.</p>
							<h2>College-Specific</h2>
							<p>Campus Cupid is designed specifically for college students, meaning that users can only connect with other users who attend the same college. This feature helps to foster a sense of community and makes it easier for users to find people who share common interests and experiences.</p>
							<h2>Conclusion</h2>
							<p>Campus Cupid is a unique dating app that offers college students a new way to find meaningful connections. By utilizing a matching algorithm that prioritizes compatibility, Campus Cupid takes the guesswork out of dating and helps users find people with whom they share common interests and values. Whether you're looking for friendship, romance, or something in between, Campus Cupid has something for everyone. So why not give it a try and find your perfect match today?</p>
